Graphic: Unemployment in Germany
===============================

This is a German graphic based on the [data about unemployment in Germany between 2005 and 2014](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq_8fKCw925zdGtmLUJFbTNHcS1fSDNxMXhpckNUemc) that is used by ZEIT Online for [their information graphic](http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/arbeitslosigkeit) about the topic. The graphic shows how the unemployment rate in Germany goes down in all German counties in the time span of nine years.

The graphic is written in d3.js and can be used as an example how to combine:
* loading data from a csv and coercing d3 to understand the values as numbers
* creating groups with circles and lines 
* color the lines according to the data
* design an axis
* set tooltips as a hover effect
* set buttons to trigger different sortings 
* show different text at different places, depending on the button clicked

The code is roughly annoated (in english).
